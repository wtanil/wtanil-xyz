<p class="indent">My Portfolio Website is crafted with the robust LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and the efficient Laravel framework. The website is structured with a service and a repository layers to ensure scalability and seamless performance.</p><p class="indent">It operates in two environmentsâ€”the Development environment for testing and refining, while the Production environment showcases the finalized content. This approach ensures that ongoing development activities do not disrupt the stability of the live site.</p><p class="indent">Driving the seamless operation is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
